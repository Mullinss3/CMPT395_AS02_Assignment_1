# CMPT395_Assignment_1
 - Kata's 1 and 3 were chosen from the TDD website (https://tddmanifesto.com/).
 - All code related to Assignment 1 from CMPT 395 course.
 - Written in Python on Wing IDE.
 - All tests were conducted in the debugger by calling a test function for each Kata 
 that runs a series of tests for each part of the function created to solve the Kata.
 - During the creation of Kata 3's second requirement, I accidently finished the third
 requirement with it but it was still tested for and came out fine.
